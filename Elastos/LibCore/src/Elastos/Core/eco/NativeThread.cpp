     * the whims of the OS scheduler, we could return and the code in our
     * thread could try to do operations on the new thread before it had
     * finished starting.
     *
     * The new thread will lock the thread list, change its state to
     * THREAD_STARTING, broadcast to gDvm.threadStartCond, and then sleep
     * on gDvm.threadStartCond (which uses the thread list lock).  This
     * thread (the parent) will either see that the thread is already ready
     * after we grab the thread list lock, or will be awakened from the
     * condition variable on the broadcast.
     *
     * We don't want to stall the rest of the VM while the new thread
     * starts, which can happen if the GC wakes up at the wrong moment.
     * So, we change our own status to VMWAIT, and self-suspend if
     * necessary after we finish adding the new thread.
     *
     *
     * We have to deal with an odd race with the GC/debugger suspension
     * mechanism when creating a new thread.  The information about whether
     * or not a thread should be suspended is contained entirely within
     * the Thread struct; this is usually cleaner to deal with than having
     * one or more globally-visible suspension flags.  The trouble is that
     * we could create the thread while the VM is trying to suspend all
     * threads.  The suspend-count won't be nonzero for the new thread,
     * so dvmChangeStatus(THREAD_RUNNING) won't cause a suspension.
     *
     * The easiest way to deal with this is to prevent the new thread from
     * running until the parent says it's okay.  This results in the
     * following (correct) sequence of events for a "badly timed" GC
     * (where '-' is us, 'o' is the child, and '+' is some other thread):
     *
     *  - call pthread_create()
     *  - lock thread list
     *  - put self into THREAD_VMWAIT so GC doesn't wait for us
     *  - sleep on condition var (mutex = thread list lock) until child starts
     *  + GC triggered by another thread
     *  + thread list locked; suspend counts updated; thread list unlocked
     *  + loop waiting for all runnable threads to suspend
     *  + success, start GC
     *  o child thread wakes, signals condition var to wake parent
     *  o child waits for parent ack on condition variable
     *  - we wake up, locking thread list
     *  - add child to thread list
     *  - unlock thread list
     *  - change our state back to THREAD_RUNNING; GC causes us to suspend
     *  + GC finishes; all threads in thread list are resumed
     *  - lock thread list
     *  - set child to THREAD_VMWAIT, and signal it to start
     *  - unlock thread list
     *  o child resumes
     *  o child changes state to THREAD_RUNNING
     *
     * The above shows the GC starting up during thread creation, but if
     * it starts anywhere after VMThread.create() is called it will
     * produce the same series of events.
     *
     * Once the child is in the thread list, it will be suspended and
     * resumed like any other thread.  In the above scenario the resume-all
     * code will try to resume the new thread, which was never actually
     * suspended, and try to decrement the child's thread suspend count to -1.
     * We can catch this in the resume-all code.
     *
     * Bouncing back and forth between threads like this adds a small amount
     * of scheduler overhead to thread startup.
     *
     * One alternative to having the child wait for the parent would be
     * to have the child inherit the parents' suspension count.  This
     * would work for a GC, since we can safely assume that the parent
     * thread didn't cause it, but we must only do so if the parent suspension
     * was caused by a suspend-all.  If the parent was being asked to
     * suspend singly by the debugger, the child should not inherit the value.
     *
     * We could also have a global "new thread suspend count" that gets
     * picked up by new threads before changing state to THREAD_RUNNING.
     * This would be protected by the thread list lock and set by a
     * suspend-all.

         *                                  (continue executing)
         *
         * We can correct this by grabbing the suspend-count lock and
         * performing both of our operations (check suspend count, set
         * state) while holding it, now we need to grab a mutex on every
         * transition to RUNNING.
         *
         * What we do instead is change the order of operations so that
         * the transition to RUNNING happens first.  If we then detect
         * that the suspend count is nonzero, we switch to SUSPENDED.
         *
         * Appropriate compiler and memory barriers are required to ensure
         * that the operations are observed in the expected order.
         *
         * This does create a small window of opportunity where a GC in
         * progress could observe what appears to be a running thread (if
         * it happens to look between when we set to RUNNING and when we
         * switch to SUSPENDED).  At worst this only affects assertions
         * and thread logging.  (We could work around it with some sort
         * of intermediate "pre-running" state that is generally treated
         * as equivalent to running, but that doesn't seem worthwhile.)
         *
         * We can also solve this by combining the "status" and "suspend
         * count" fields into a single 32-bit value.  This trades the
         * store/load barrier on transition to RUNNING for an atomic RMW
         * op on all transitions and all suspend count updates (also, all
         * accesses to status or the thread count require bit-fiddling).
         * It also eliminates the brief transition through RUNNING when
         * the thread is supposed to be suspended.  This is possibly faster

 *  - blocked in wait(), wait(long), or wait(long, int) methods of Object
 *  - blocked in join(), join(long), or join(long, int) methods of Thread
