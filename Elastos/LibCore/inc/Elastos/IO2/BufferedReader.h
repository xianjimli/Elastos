/**
 * Wraps an existing {@link Reader} and <em>buffers</em> the input. Expensive
 * interaction with the underlying reader is minimized, since most (smaller)
 * requests can be satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that
 * some extra space is required to hold the buffer and that copying takes place
 * when filling that buffer, but this is usually outweighed by the performance
 * benefits.
 *
 * <p/>A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:<p/>
 *
 * <pre>
 * BufferedReader buf = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;file.java&quot;));
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see BufferedWriter
 * @since 1.1
