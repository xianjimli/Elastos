
Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
And on the farm he had a pig, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
With a oink-oink here and a oink-oink there.
Here a oink, there a oink, everywhere a oink-oink.

Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
And on the farm he had a cat, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
With a meow-meow here and a meow-meow there.
Here a meow, there a meow, everywhere a meow-meow.

Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh-igh, ee-igh-igh, ohh!!
