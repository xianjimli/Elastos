========================
Generic (from Wikipedia)
========================

Generic means pertaining or appropriate to large classes or groups
as opposed to specific members of the group.


==============================
Generic brand (from Wikipedia)
==============================

Generic brands of consumer products (often supermarket goods) are
distinguished by the absence of a brand name.

They may be manufactured by less prominent companies, or manufactured
on the same production line as a 'named' brand. Generic brands are usually
priced below those products sold by supermarkets under their own brand
(frequently referred to as "store brands" or "own brands"). Generally they
imitate these more expensive brands, competing on price. Generic brand
products are often of equal quality as a branded product, however, the
quality may change suddenly in either direction with no change in the
packaging if the supplier for the product changes.


==============================
Generic drugs (from Wikipedia)
==============================

Patents may prohibit generic brand manufacturing. In the specific case
of drugs, new drugs are almost always patented and therefore generic
versions of drugs may only be made legally in most of the world when
the patents expire. As with other generic products, generic drugs are
much cheaper but both competition and the fact that research and marketing
costs do not need to be factored in.


====================================
Generic programming (from Wikipedia)
====================================

Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms
are written in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then
instantiated when needed for specific types provided as parameters and was
pioneered by Ada which appeared in 1983. This approach permits writing
common functions or types that differ only in the set of types on which
they operate when used, thus reducing duplication. Software entities created
using generic programming are known as generics in Ada, Eiffel, Java, C#,
Visual Basic .NET and Haskell; templates in C++; and parameterized types
in the influential 1994 book "Design Patterns". The authors of Design
Patterns note that this technique, especially when combined with delegation,
is very powerful but that "Dynamic, highly parameterized software is harder
to understand than more static software."

Generic programming refers to features of certain statically typed
programming languages that allow some code to effectively circumvent the
static typing requirements. For instance in C++, a template is a routine
in which some parameters are qualified by a type variable. Since code
generation in C++ depends on concrete types, the template is specialized
for each combination of argument types that occur in practice. Generic
programming is commonly used to implement containers such as lists and
hash tables and functions such as a particular sorting algorithm for
objects specified in terms more general than a concrete type.


================================
Metaprogramming (from Wikipedia)
================================

Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or
manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data, or that do part
of the work at compile time that is otherwise done at runtime.
In many cases, this allows programmers to get more done in the same amount
of time as they would take to write all the code manually.

The language in which the metaprogram is written is called the metalanguage.
The language of the programs that are manipulated is called the object
language. The ability of a programming language to be its own metalanguage
is called reflection or reflexivity.

Reflection is a valuable language feature to facilitate metaprogramming.
Having the programming language itself as a first-class data type (as in
Lisp or Rebol) is also very useful. Generic programming invokes a
metaprogramming facility within a language, in those languages supporting it.

Metaprogramming usually works through one of two ways. The first way is to
expose the internals of the run-time engine to the programming code through
application programming interfaces (APIs). The second approach is dynamic
execution of string expressions that contain programming commands. Thus,
"programs can write programs". Although both approaches can be used, most
languages tend to lean toward one or the other.
