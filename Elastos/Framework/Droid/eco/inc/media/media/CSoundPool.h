/**
 * The SoundPool class manages and plays audio resources for applications.
 *
 * <p>A SoundPool is a collection of samples that can be loaded into memory
 * from a resource inside the APK or from a file in the file system. The
 * SoundPool library uses the MediaPlayer service to decode the audio
 * into a raw 16-bit PCM mono or stereo stream. This allows applications
 * to ship with compressed streams without having to suffer the CPU load
 * and latency of decompressing during playback.</p>
 *
 * <p>In addition to low-latency playback, SoundPool can also manage the number
 * of audio streams being rendered at once. When the SoundPool object is
 * constructed, the maxStreams parameter sets the maximum number of streams
 * that can be played at a time from this single SoundPool. SoundPool tracks
 * the number of active streams. If the maximum number of streams is exceeded,
 * SoundPool will automatically stop a previously playing stream based first
 * on priority and then by age within that priority. Limiting the maximum
 * number of streams helps to cap CPU loading and reducing the likelihood that
 * audio mixing will impact visuals or UI performance.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sounds can be looped by setting a non-zero loop value. A value of -1
 * causes the sound to loop forever. In this case, the application must
 * explicitly call the stop() function to stop the sound. Any other non-zero
 * value will cause the sound to repeat the specified number of times, e.g.
 * a value of 3 causes the sound to play a total of 4 times.</p>
 *
 * <p>The playback rate can also be changed. A playback rate of 1.0 causes
 * the sound to play at its original frequency (resampled, if necessary,
 * to the hardware output frequency). A playback rate of 2.0 causes the
 * sound to play at twice its original frequency, and a playback rate of
 * 0.5 causes it to play at half its original frequency. The playback
 * rate range is 0.5 to 2.0.</p>
 *
 * <p>Priority runs low to high, i.e. higher numbers are higher priority.
 * Priority is used when a call to play() would cause the number of active
 * streams to exceed the value established by the maxStreams parameter when
 * the SoundPool was created. In this case, the stream allocator will stop
 * the lowest priority stream. If there are multiple streams with the same
 * low priority, it will choose the oldest stream to stop. In the case
 * where the priority of the new stream is lower than all the active
 * streams, the new sound will not play and the play() function will return
 * a streamID of zero.</p>
 *
 * <p>Let's examine a typical use case: A game consists of several levels of
 * play. For each level, there is a set of unique sounds that are used only
 * by that level. In this case, the game logic should create a new SoundPool
 * object when the first level is loaded. The level data itself might contain
 * the list of sounds to be used by this level. The loading logic iterates
 * through the list of sounds calling the appropriate SoundPool.load()
 * function. This should typically be done early in the process to allow time
 * for decompressing the audio to raw PCM format before they are needed for
 * playback.</p>
 *
 * <p>Once the sounds are loaded and play has started, the application can
 * trigger sounds by calling SoundPool.play(). Playing streams can be
 * paused or resumed, and the application can also alter the pitch by
 * adjusting the playback rate in real-time for doppler or synthesis
 * effects.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that since streams can be stopped due to resource constraints, the
 * streamID is a reference to a particular instance of a stream. If the stream
 * is stopped to allow a higher priority stream to play, the stream is no
 * longer be valid. However, the application is allowed to call methods on
 * the streamID without error. This may help simplify program logic since
 * the application need not concern itself with the stream lifecycle.</p>
 *
 * <p>In our example, when the player has completed the level, the game
 * logic should call SoundPool.release() to release all the native resources
 * in use and then set the SoundPool reference to NULL. If the player starts
 * another level, a new SoundPool is created, sounds are loaded, and play
 * resumes.</p>
