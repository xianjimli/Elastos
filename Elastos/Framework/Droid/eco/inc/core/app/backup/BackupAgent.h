/**
 * Provides the central interface between an
 * application and Android's data backup infrastructure.  An application that wishes
 * to participate in the backup and restore mechanism will declare a subclass of
 * {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent}, implement the
 * {@link #onBackup(ParcelFileDescriptor, BackupDataOutput, ParcelFileDescriptor) onBackup()}
 * and {@link #onRestore(BackupDataInput, int, ParcelFileDescriptor) onRestore()} methods,
 * and provide the name of its backup agent class in its {@code AndroidManifest.xml} file via
 * the <code><a
 * href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
 * tag's {@code android:backupAgent} attribute.
 * <h3>Basic Operation</h3>
 * <p>
 * When the application makes changes to data that it wishes to keep backed up,
 * it should call the
 * {@link android.app.backup.BackupManager#dataChanged() BackupManager.dataChanged()} method.
 * This notifies the Android Backup Manager that the application needs an opportunity
 * to update its backup image.  The Backup Manager, in turn, schedules a
 * backup pass to be performed at an opportune time.
 * <p>
 * Restore operations are typically performed only when applications are first
 * installed on a device.  At that time, the operating system checks to see whether
 * there is a previously-saved data set available for the application being installed, and if so,
 * begins an immediate restore pass to deliver the backup data as part of the installation
 * process.
 * <p>
 * When a backup or restore pass is run, the application's process is launched
 * (if not already running), the manifest-declared backup agent class (in the {@code
 * android:backupAgent} attribute) is instantiated within
 * that process, and the agent's {@link #onCreate()} method is invoked.  This prepares the
 * agent instance to run the actual backup or restore logic.  At this point the
 * agent's
 * {@link #onBackup(ParcelFileDescriptor, BackupDataOutput, ParcelFileDescriptor) onBackup()} or
 * {@link #onRestore(BackupDataInput, int, ParcelFileDescriptor) onRestore()} method will be
 * invoked as appropriate for the operation being performed.
 * <p>
 * A backup data set consists of one or more "entities," flattened binary data
 * records that are each identified with a key string unique within the data set.  Adding a
 * record to the active data set or updating an existing record is done by simply
 * writing new entity data under the desired key.  Deleting an entity from the data set
 * is done by writing an entity under that key with header specifying a negative data
 * size, and no actual entity data.
 * <p>
 * <b>Helper Classes</b>
 * <p>
 * An extensible agent based on convenient helper classes is available in
 * {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper}.  That class is particularly
 * suited to handling of simple file or {@link android.content.SharedPreferences}
 * backup and restore.
